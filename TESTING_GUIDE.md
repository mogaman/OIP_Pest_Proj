## 🎯 Specific Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Complete Workflow**
1. Upload `green_aphids_test.jpg`
2. Verify it predicts "Aphids"
3. Save the analysis with notes
4. Go to History page
5. Find the saved analysis
6. Add treatment record
7. Add follow-up notes

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Pest Types**
1. Upload each test image
2. Compare predictions:
   - Green → Aphids (high confidence)
   - Red → Mites (medium confidence) 
   - Blue → Thrips (medium confidence)
   - Mixed → Random pest (variable confidence)

### **Scenario 3: Chat Consultation**
1. Ask: "I found small green insects on my tomato plants"

## 📈 Expected Results

### **Pest Predictions**
| Image Color | Expected Pest | Typical Confidence |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Green       | Aphids        | 80-95%           |
| Red         | Mites         | 70-85%           |
